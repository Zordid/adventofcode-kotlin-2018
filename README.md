# adventofcode-kotlin-2018

My solutions to the great and ingenious [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018) coding
challenge by Eric Wastl.

I am doing these challenges for the second year in a row now and I am totally addicted to them.
If you are into *programming*, into *logic*, maybe also a little bit into *competition*, this one is for you
as well!

My solutions

...are mostly written in Kotlin, so I will use this repo to show how it could be done.

My daily routine in December

...I set my alarm clock to 5:55 in the morning. Get up, prepare a coffee while then starting to read the challenge 
text on my tablet. My first coding is usually quite dirty, but solve the puzzles. Then in the second iteration I
clean things up - because I am a clean code guy.

I want my code to be concise, clean, readable and fast. All of these things are supported perfectly by Kotlin,
by the way. :)

My repo

...is just *my* solution. There generally is no *best* solution, let alone a *single* solution.
I tweak my code quite a bit before I am pleased and happy.
